                    | is a collection of journal and coffee tables which recreate a unique process of blossoming in their appearance, 
                    | from a fragile bud to a powerful strong flower.

                    | The combination of a sleek real leather and soft suede of Italian production, 
                    | black glass, which reminds of obsidian, 
                    | and soft proportions – we offer a new understanding of the modern luxury atmosphere.

                    | The debut collection from Studia 54 was developed by brand designers and Production 54’ specialists. 
                    | The concept was in the synthesis of functionality, fantasy, and the search for new solutions. 
                    | This is how we got a “calling card” form of our brand.
